## :pencil2: Planning & Problem Solving
- Initial stage of planning was easy for me but later I have  decided to reduce the amount of ideas I have implemented with my limited timeframe. 

- I have created a simple tic-box schedule with my MS project knowledge and I wanted to keep a track of my progress with tasks that I have planned.

- see below for tic-box plan I've created for tic-tac-toe game.

- [ ] 9 boxes for game deck
- [ ] Two buttons for players 1 & 2
- [ ] Three buttons -Start, restart and Quit button
- [ ] Select Players deck
- [ ] One box to show player wins(optional -How many times wins) 
- [ ] CSS styling - key values
- Flow charts of app logic.
